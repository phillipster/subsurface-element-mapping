# Subsurface Element Mapping
Hello! This project represents the culmination of a project made as part of the 2024 NYU Tandon School of Engineering Undergraduate Summer Research Program. Note: this project uses ArcGIS; QGIS and other software suites will not be compatible.
## Accessing Our Work
1. Have ArcGIS installed on the machine that will be used to open and view the project.

2. Double click on the "Subsurface Elements.aprx" shortcut at the root directory of the repository.

3. On the left bar, select and unselect a particular map. The name of the object corresponds to a particular historical site listed here:
